<h2 id="the-development-phase">The Development Phase</h2>
<p>The development phase begins immediately after conception, together
with design it makes up the core of the software development
process. For software engineers, the development phase is their time
to shine. In this stage, user stories are scheduled for development on
a week-by-week basis for the engineering team to work on. Initially,
the focus is on building the functionality of the MVP, while the
design team works in parallel designing the whole user interface and
user experience according to the user stories and mockups. Once the
design team starts producing designs, those are to be implemented into
the final product that will be delivered.</p>
<h3 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h3>
<p>Right before starting the development process, take the time to
establish clear and redundant communication paths between the client
and the team. <strong>It is preferable to over-communicate than to
under-communicate.</strong></p>
<p>Good communication is the #1 way to avoid overly long meetings and
last minute changes of heart. Involve the client, engage and
listen. Good communication between the team members avoids bugs and
problems down the road. As with the discovery meetings, take time to
schedule <em>pre-</em> and <em>post-meetings</em> where you review what was done and
what will be done now.</p>
<p>What you should do to onboard the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up <a href="http://www.slack.com">Slack</a> for real time communication
  with the client.  This involves going to
  <a href="http://www.slack.com">Slack</a> and creating an account with the name
  of the product or company
  (i.e. <a href="http://talpor.slack.com">http://talpor.slack.com</a>).</li>
<li>Set up a board on <a href="http://www.trello.com">Trello</a> in the talPor
  organization to track what is being done on the project. Create the
  recommended lists from our <a href="methodology/trello/">Trello section</a>
  of the methodology docs.</li>
<li>Use the integrations between your tools, for example Slack-Trello
  integration can be useful to notify the client new changes are
  deployed.</li>
<li>Schedule a fixed day and time for the weekly meeting with your
  client.  <strong>Be on time</strong>. If you are being dilligent about keeping
  your communication paths open, meetings should be just a summary of
  what was done and what is going to be worked on during the week.</li>
<li>Schedule meetings with your teammates before and after the weekly
  meeting.  Details on what to do at each of these meetings can be
  found in the <a href="methodology/meetings/">Meeting section</a> of the
  Methodology docs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>For our development process we use an agile methodology. Our
methodology draws from Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), both
well-known and well-documented agile methodologies. Therefore, to get
details regarding our practices that escape the scope of this
handbook, the documentation for these methodologies is the place to
look.</p>
<p>So, what does using an agile methodology entail? It means we expect
project requirements to be constantly evolving and what we developed a
week ago can be very far from what we're building for tomorrow. You
might be wondering: <strong>"What the hell? How are you supposed to plan and
build software under those conditions?"</strong>. Well, we do.</p>
<p>Agile methodologies were born out of the inability of other
methodologies, like RUP or Waterfall, to adapt to unavoidable changes
that occur while a product is being developed. So how do we handle
this and keep our clients happy? We follow incremental design
guidelines and an iterative development process in order to minimize
the risks that this constant evolution entails.</p>
<p>There are several techniques and weekly tasks that need to be followed
as part of talPor's methodology so read on to the
<a href="methodology/">Methodology</a> section for further detail of
what needs to be done during a project's life cycle.</p>
<h3 id="technical-standards">Technical standards</h3>
<p>We're a tech company that builds products and in order to deliver a
great product we need to be writing great code and using the best
tools and software for the job. Also, in order to share our experience
as a team, we need to be on the same page as to what software we're
using as well as how we're using it. To accomplish both those things
we have a set of standards and recommendations that are documented in
the <a href="./tech/">Technical Standards</a> section.</p></div>
