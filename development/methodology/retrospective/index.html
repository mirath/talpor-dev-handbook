<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>During a project's life it's important to evaluate, inspect and adapt 
the applied methods and teamwork. The <strong>Retrospective</strong> is a process 
used to gather feedback about a project not just in technical terms 
but in the team and team issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Retrospectives</em> enables whole-team learning, act as catalysts for 
change, and generate action.
<cite>Agile retrospectives, Esther Derby, Diana Larsen</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This process is done through a <em>Retrospective Meeting</em> where the team gathers
to discuss about the project. This meeting is meant to be carried 
out periodically, in talPor, we do <strong>monthly</strong> <em>Restrospective Meetings</em> and
we apply several of the retrospectives techniques described in the book
<em>Agile retrospectives by Esther Derby, Diana Larsen</em>. </p>
<p>For the retrospective meetings there's usually one person in charge of 
leading it, for Scrum this person would be the <em>Scrum Master</em>. However,
in our case, since we have small teams and we want to evaluate the whole
team, we include one person from a different team to lead the process. 
We also do this because the presence of a person that is not familiarized 
with the project gives us an objective point of view to the meeting which 
can lead us to discover problems that the members of the team didn't recognize. </p>
<p>At the end of the retrospective meeting we obtain a set of identified issues
which we classify as <em>Things to improve</em>, <em>Things to be kept</em> and 
<em>Things to be removed</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-retrospective-meeting">The Retrospective Meeting</h2>
<p>In this section we'll describe as detail as possible the process we use to 
carry out the meeting.  As we explained above, we use some of the techniques
describes in the <em>Agile retrospectives</em> books to carry out the meeting. It's
important that the person in charge of the meeting prepare a little bit beforehand
in oder to prevent improvisation during the meeting. Also, it's important to 
apply different techniques and to vary the activities, the retrospective should 
not become a boring and repetitive activity, otherwise, you'll end up optaining 
meaningless outcomes.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to evaluate the state of the team and the context in
which it is developing in order to select the correct type of activities to be
applied during he meeting. This means, you should evaluate if the team needs to
discover failures, if you want to know what's the root of one or some problems,
if you have identified that there are problems between some team members, etc.</p>
<p>The activities to be selected for the retrospective meeting should be inclined 
towards the context of the team, as explained above. </p>
<p>The retrospective meeting is usually structured in the following form:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Set the stage:</strong> In this stage the retrospective leader sets the goals and the
common ground of the meeting. This helps people focus on the work at hand, to
undestand the goals and how they will spend their time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gather data:</strong> Not all the participants involved in the retrospective have the
same point of view, have been present in all the iteration days nor see the same.
That's why gathering data about what's happened during the iteration is important
to have a general picture so that everyone are in the same page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Generate insights:</strong> In this phase the team identifies the strengths and issues
about the iteration. It's the moment to ask <em>Why?</em>, identify causes and effects,
consider different possibilities and think about them analitically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decide what to do:</strong> At this point the team should have a list of potential
experiments and improvements. Sometimes you can come up with a lot of improvements
and things to do, but it's recommended to select a realistic subset of those - What 
you consider the most relevant - and work with those for the next iteration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Close the retrospective:</strong> In this phase you decide how to document the retrospective
and plan a follow-up. It's important for the team to retain the learning outcome from
the retrospective and apply it successfully.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="example-of-our-retrospective">Example of our Retrospective</h2>
<p>As a base start for a retrospective, we have selected some activities which we'll 
explain below. These activities were selected for the first retrospective of a 
started project which had more than 3 months of development, so we wanted to focus 
on getting and overview of what was going on with it.</p>
<p>Since we are a highly distributed team not all the team members where in the same 
place geographicall. For that we used a tool called 
<a href="https://realtimeboard.com"><em>Real Time Board</em></a> to maintain the real time dynamic 
of the <em>Retrospective Meeting</em>.</p>
<p>We selected the following set of activities from the <em>Agile Retrospectives</em> book
for the meeting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Set the Stage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Check-in and Working agreement:</em> We started setting the ground rules and 
remembering our [Guiding principles] (/talpor-dev-handbook/#the-guiding-principles).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gather data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Timeline with color coding events and dot voting:</em> This was our first 
retrospective, so we wanted to identify all the relevant events of the 
project's life and categorize them. Also, we voted if the event was positive 
or negative for the project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Generate Insights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Patterns and shift:</em> We discussed the events generated in the timeline and 
analyzed them trying to find patterns and possible causes. As outcome we obtained 
a list of actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decide what to do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Prioritize with dots:</em> Based on the obtained list, we dot voted the actions to 
take and classified them as <em>Things to improve</em>, <em>Things to be kept</em> and 
<em>Things to be removed</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Close the retrospective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>+/Delta</em>: We analyzed the retrospective process looking for strengths and 
possible improvements for the next retrospective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
