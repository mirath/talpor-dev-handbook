<h2 id="the-talpor-philosophy">The talPor Philosophy</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Whether you are onboarding on a new project, or just hotfixing a
problem in an old one, software development is <strong>hard</strong>.</p>
<p>Building software is not only technically hard, but like any other
problem, it depends highly on the human factor. Successfully shaping
and taking ideas from just a thought all the way into a successful
product involves tons of work. From the starting point, many
variables, like your client, developers, designers, among others, must
be aligned towards the goal of successfully shipping the product.</p>
<p>This document intends to outline what we believe to be the best
practices at all the stages related to software development. As
anything, it isn't written in stone, but rather is what we believe to
be sound advice in making software development successful.</p>
<h3 id="the-guiding-principles">The Guiding Principles</h3>
<p>At <a href="https://talpor.com">talPor</a>, we function as a multi-disciplinary,
distributed team.  We tend to work on small teams (generally, by
project) which support and collaborate with each other. These guiding
principles, enumerated below, are the core of our philosophy. Embrace
them, and put them to practice.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not be afraid to make mistakes.</strong> Mistakes happen. You will
   over or under-estimate that feature. You will completely
   misunderstand your client. You will break a build for everyone in
   your team. You will manage to take down production on a rainy
   day. <em>It</em> happens. And it will happen again. The whole point of
   this philosophy is to <em>minimize</em> the number of times that happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Always try to do your best.</strong> Even if you have done it a million
   times, or if it is the first time you get on board on a project,
   always make solid decisions. It doesn't really matter if you have
   been in the project from the get go, or you are just joining to
   hotfix that annoying problem, take that extra time to first
   <em>understand</em> the requirements, and then <em>build</em> or <em>fix</em> whatever
   needs to be fixed as best as you possibly can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask for help.</strong> As previously said, we are a small team which is
   always ready to provide help when needed. Don't be afraid to ask if
   someone has ever done this or that. Don't be afraid to say you
   don't know the answer. Don't be afraid to say you don't know how to
   do something in particular. Likewise, offer your help or advice
   when you do know what is going on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Never take it personally.</strong> This one is related to #1. It will
   come the time when that feature branch you poured yourself into
   will not make it to production. It will happen that your code will
   take down production, or make the wrong assumptions. It will come
   the time that you will be told you are doing it wrong. You are not
   what you code or what you design, and you are not the project you
   are on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be impeccable with your words</strong> This one refers to the way you
   express yourself. Words are much more than the constructs of
   phrases that comes out of your mounth, they carry emotions,
   actions, thoughts or attitudes.  Express yourself with integrity,
   say what you mean and avoid your <em>word</em> to express jealousy, envy,
   frustration, fear or anger. We respect each other ideas and
   thoughts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't make assumptions</strong> When you are working on teams,
   communication is fundamental to guarantee success in any
   project. You cannot assume what others think, so being a little
   verbose is not that bad. Misunderstandings occurs and you may end
   up not deploying something into production because you assumed that
   another one was going to do it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="who-is-this-for">Who is this for?</h3>
<p>This document is primarily geared towards any talPor employees. It is
intended to contain glimpses of what we believe to be solid software
engineering, from the project conception phase up to pivoting and
iterations of a project.</p>
<p>As such, anyone that partakes in any of the phases of software
development, can benefit from reading and practicing what is on this
document.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-this-document-structured">How is this document structured?</h3>
<p>The rest of this document is structured trying to follow the common
software development flow.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="conception/"><strong>Conception</strong></a> happens from the minute a new
   client walks in, or a new internal project is started. Meeting the
   client, understanding requirements, forming teams, estimating
   features all happens at this stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="development/"><strong>Development</strong></a> is when the first version
   of the product is built. Smart technology decisions, good
   practices, and impeccable communication are key at this stage. This
   section is also were we go into detail about the methodology we use
   during projects as well as best practices for development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="deployment/"><strong>Deployment</strong></a> of the project into
   production. Dealing with showstopper bugs, the 90/10 rule, handling
   staging and production servers, dealing with bugs on production,
   continuous integration.</p>
</li>
