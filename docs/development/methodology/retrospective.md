## The process

During each project it's important to evaluate, inspect and adapt 
the applied methods and teamwork. The **Retrospective** is a process 
used to gather feedback about a project not just in technical terms 
but in the team and team issues.

> *Retrospectives* enables whole-team learning, act as catalysts for 
> change, and generate action.
> <cite>Agile retrospectives, Esther Derby, Diana Larsen</cite>

This process is done through a *Retrospective Meeting* where the team gathers
to discuss about the project. This meeting is meant to be carried 
out periodically, in talPor, we do **monthly** *Restrospective Meetings* and
we apply several of the retrospectives techniques described in the book
*Agile retrospectives by Esther Derby, Diana Larsen*. 

For the retrospective meetings there's usually one person in charge of 
leading it, for Scrum this person would be the *Scrum Master*. However,
in our case, since we have small teams and we want to evaluate the whole
team, we include one person from a different team to lead the process. 
We also do this because the presence of a person that is not familiarized 
with the project gives us an objective point of view to the meeting which 
can lead us to discover problems that the members of the team didn't recognize. 

At the end of the retrospective meeting we obtain a set of identified issues
which we classify as *Things to improve*, *Things to be kept* and 
*Things to be removed*.

## The retrospective meeting

In this section we'll describe as detail as possible the process we use to 
carry out the meeting.  As we explained above, we use some of the techniques
describes in the *Agile retrospectives* books to carry out the meeting. It's
important that the person in charge of the meeting prepare a little bit beforehand
in oder to prevent improvisation during the meeting. Also, it's important to 
apply different techniques and to vary the activities, the retrospective should 
not become a boring and repetitive activity, otherwise, you'll end up optaining 
meaningless outcomes.

The most important thing is to evaluate the state of the team and the context in
which it is developing in order to select the correct type of activities to be
applied during he meeting. This means, you should evaluate if the team needs to
discover failures, if you want to know what's the root of one or some problems,
if you have identified that there are problems between some team members, etc.

The activities to be selected for the retrospective meeting should be inclined 
towards the context of the team, as explained above. 

1. Set the stage
2. Gather data
3. Generate insights
4. Decide what to do
5. Close the retrospective




## Example retrospective


As a base start for a 
retrospective, we have selected some activities which we'll explain below. These
activities were selected for the first retrospective of an started project which
had more than 3 months of development, so we wanted to focus on getting and 
overview of what was going on with it.
